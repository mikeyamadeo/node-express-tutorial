# node-mongo-tutorial
We will use expressjs, an abstraction on top of node's http library, to retrieve and post data.

We will cover:

1. get data with expressjs
2. post data with expressjs

Before we do this, let's get up and running.


## Pre-reqs

- Node w/ npm must be installed. If that is not the case, learn how [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- MongoDB must be installed. If that is not the case, learn how [here](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

## Up and Running

##### 1. Clone repo
Make sure to clone this repository

##### 2. Run the server
We can make sure our server is running by executing the following in the terminal

`node api-server.js`

If we go to port 4000 we should see a red screen instructing us to set up our endpoint. If you are using your local machine you would go to [http://localhost:4000/index.html](http://localhost:4000/index.html)

`git clone https://github.com/mikeyamadeo/node-mongo-tutorial.git`

##### 3. Start MongoDB
If mongodb is installed, we should run the following in the terminal to get mongodb running

`mongod`
